# Note: This was my second attempt after learning from the weaknesses in my draft version in draft.py
# This version was also done without looking at tutorials or suggested solution, except for the list of cards.
# After realising that the completed solution contains card number 11, I briefly looked at the suggested solution.
# I took the list of cards from the suggested solution which mirrors the card deck better and improve the odds more realistically.
# cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# Alas, this version of mine still has a weakness and I have missed out an important part of the real Blackjack game:
# That if 11 is in cards and the sum of cards is above 21, 11 will be counted as 1:
# if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
#         cards.remove(11)
#         cards.append(1)
# It is structurally difficult to include this feature without a major revamp.
# Therefore I am keeping this version here as a testament to writing them without looking at the solution.
# Possibility of revisiting and rewriting this in the future.
# For future solution, Claude has suggested: Rewrite just the score calculation — add a calculate_score() function to your existing code that handles the ace rule. You don't need to restructure everything.
